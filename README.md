# mag.net

mag.net is a networking app that provides a hub for students, industry professionals, and other members of the women and non-binary STEM community to (net)work with each other

mag.net has 3 main components: build a community, foster connections, and create networking opportunities. It allows a user to log in and add profile information, which would be used to match a user with others of similar interests. The app's layout was designed with a mentor-mentee relationship in mind to provide a support system for those who use our app. It also has a map feature that lets you see where your friends are to make in-person meet-ups easy. 
There is also a mock-up for an explore page for finding opportunities.
